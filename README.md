# Simulation Class LAB PUCCM

The purpose of this repository is to keep tracking of the examples of work for
the class of simulation. Some topics will be covered with Python other with R,
depending on the best tool for the job and the clarity of the results.


# Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing.

### Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook
Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the *IPython notebook*,
and language specific code, such as the *IPython kernel for Python*. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.
